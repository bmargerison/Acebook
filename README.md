# AceBook

Working in a team of 7, during weeks 8 and 9 of the Makers Academy course the task was to recreate many elements of a social media site such as Facebook. 

### Use

###### Main app
The app was built using Ruby on Rails. To run on your machine please clone and run:
`bundle install`
`bin/rails db:create`
`bin/rails db:migrate`
`bin/rails server`
Please also ensure your machine has imagemagik installed:
`brew install imagemagick`
You can then visit and use the app at http://localhost:3000

To see test coverage run:
`bundle exec rspec`

###### Secondary

The app also has a secondary front-end, built using React, with the functionality to view and make posts. Please ensure you have created a user on the main app in order to be able to make a post, and ensure the backend is running as above. Navigate to /app/react-frontend, then run:
`npm install`
`npm start`

### Functionality



### Appraoch 

We started by agreeing on the processes we would adhere to as a team over the 2 weeks: daily stand ups and retros, pull requests, raising issues. 

We started the project with planning sessions and diagramming, before working through the assigned user stories in 3 separate groups.
